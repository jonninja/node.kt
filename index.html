        <p>Node.kt is a web framework written in Kotlin inspired by many of the ideas in Node.JS and the Express
            framework.</p>
        <p>Part of the appeal of Node.js is the ability to create web applications that are easy to understand and to do
            so extremely quickly. For example, here's a node.js 'Hello World' application:</p>

<pre><code>var express = require('express'),
    app = express.createServer();
    app.get('/', function(req, res){
    res.send('Hello World');
    });
    app.listen(3000);
</code></pre>
        <p>What makes this appealing isn't the few lines of code - a servlet based Hello World might not be that
            much more code. But the Express version is extremely easy to follow. There are no configuration files.
            There are no annotations. On larger scale applications, this might not matter much, but there is an
            enormous appeal to this kind of programming model, if the popularity of Node is any indication.</p>
        <p>Here's a Node.kt version of the same application:</p>

<pre><code>fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {
    val app = ExpressNetty()
    app.get("/", {
    res.send("Hello World")
    })
    app.listen(3000)
    }
</code></pre>
        <p>So why not use Node.js? Well, despite some excellent ideas in its frameworks, Node.js is built on Javascript,
            and that imposes some serious limitations. First, Javascript is completely dynamic, which means no
            type-safety at compile time. I won't go through the entire debate - some prefer this - but my taste is for
            solid, development-time type checking. Second, Javascript is single-threaded, and imposes a callback-style
            of coding that, for some, can be quite confusing and difficult to parse. When working in Node.js, one seems
            to always be asking the question, 'Is this really making me more productive?'</p>

        <p>Kotlin, on the other hand, is a more modern version of Java, built on the solid foundation of years of JVM
            engineering. While still in development, the combination of Kotlin and Node.kt makes web development far
            more pleasurable. Some of Java's verbosity is reduced, and as you can see in the above example, it's
            possible to express ideas with minimal code while still being very clear.</p>

        <h2>What's Included?</h2>

        <h3>The Core framework</h3>

        <p>Based on Express, the framework provides the core functionality of Node.kt. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Express - a web server framework inspired by Express.js</li>
            <li>Middleware - a collection of middleware useful on a wide range of web server projects</li>
            <li>Http - an http client</li>
            <li>Crypto - easy access to encryption and encoding</li>
        </ul>
